\section{Classification theorem for the Larson--Wogen system}
  \label{section:lw-sys}
  In this section we study the canonical example of the Larson--Wogen~\eqref{lw-sys} vector system $\fsys_{LW}$.
  Namely, we prove a theorem similar to Theorem 2.2 of~\cite{katavolos}.
  Up until now there existed two different techniques in studying the $k$ point density for $k=1$ (strong $M$-basisness) and for $k\geq2$.
  Here we present a single method for the analysis of the $k$ point density property.
  \begin{theorem}
    \label{thm:katavolos}
    Firstly, the sequences $\{f_j\}_{j=0}^\infty$, $\{f^*_j\}_{j=0}^\infty$ are biorthogonal
      and both are complete in $\cal{H}$ (so $\fsys_{LW}$ is an $M$-basis).
    Secondly, the following is true.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item  The system~\eqref{lw-sys} is NOT one point dense (a strong $M$-basis) if and only if the sequence
        \begin{equation}
          \mu_n = \frac{a_{n-1} a_{n-3} \dots}{a_{n} a_{n-2} \dots }
        \end{equation}
        belongs to $\ell^2$.
      \item The system is NOT $k$ point dense ($k > 1$) if and only if the sequence $\{1/a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ belongs to $\ell^1$.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}
    Again consider a $k$-dimensional operator $T =  \sum_{s=1}^k y^s \otimes x^s$ which annihilates $R_1(\cal{A})$.
    For the given $M$-basis $\fsys = \fsys_{LW}$ we might calculate $\Xi_n$ precisely.
    \begin{align*}
      \Xi_{2n-1} &= -a_{2n}T_{2n - 1, 2n},\\
      \Xi_{2n} &= -a_{2n + 1}T_{2n + 1, 2n},
    \end{align*}
      having $T_{ij}$ equal to the $\inner{Te_j}{e_i}$.
    %\begin{remark}
      %If such operator $T$ exists and has a non-zero trace, then the sequence $1/a_k$ is summable.
    %\end{remark}
    %\begin{proof}
      %Suppose the trace is equal to $-1$ without loss of generality.
      %Then $\Xi_k$ tend to $1$ with $k$ going to infinity. Since $T_{k-1, k}$ as well as $T_{k, k-1}$
        %is a summable sequence for any trace operator $T$, we get the required condition.
    %\end{proof}
    Consider Proposition~\ref{thm:kreformulation}.
    We start from getting the new expressions for $\Xi_n$ via the vectors $u_n$ and $v_n$.
    %Next we express $\Xi_n$ using the scalar product of the vectors $u_n$ and $v_n$, defined in the previous section.
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{aligned}
        \Xi_{2n-1} &= -a_{2n} \sum_{s=1}^k y^s_{2n} x^s_{2n-1} = -a_{2n} \inner{u_{2n}}{v_{2n-1}},\\
        \Xi_{2n} &= -a_{2n+1} \sum_{s=1}^k y^s_{2n} x^s_{2n+1} = -a_{2n+1} \inner{u_{2n}}{v_{2n+1}},
      \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
      where $\langle\cdot, \cdot\rangle$ denotes a standard scalar product in the $\mathbb{R}^k$.

    Now we introduce the sequences of vectors $w_n$ and $w^*_n$.
    \begin{align*}
      w_{2n} &= u_{2n} \quad w^*_{2n} &= v_{2n},\\
      w_{2n+1} &= v_{2n+1} \quad w^*_{2n+1} &= u_{2n+1}.
    \end{align*}
    Proposition~\ref{prop:kreformulation} asserts that $k$ point density is equivalent to the existence of
      such $k$-dimensional vectors $w_s$, $w^*_s$ lying in $\ell^2(\mathbb{R}^k)$ which comply with the equation
    \begin{equation}
      \label{eq:vector2}
      \sum_{s=0}^n \inner{w_s}{w^*_s} = -a_{n+1} \inner{w_n}{w_{n+1}},
    \end{equation}
      for any $n \geq 0$, such that $\sum_{s=0}^\infty \inner{w_s}{w^*_s} \neq 0$.

    In what follows we prove that the conditions in the previous proposition can be simplified.
    \begin{prop}
      \label{prop:reformulation-lw}
      Such $k$-dimensional vectors $w_s$, $w^*_s$ do exist if and only if there exists such $r_s$ in $\ell^2(\mathbb{R}^k)$
        satisfying the following.
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:vector3}
        a_{n+1} \inner{r_n}{r_{n+1}} = 1,
      \end{equation}
      for any $n \geq 0$.
    \end{prop}
    \begin{proof}
      Suppose we found such $r_n$.
      Then we easily solve the original proposition by putting $w^*_s$ to zero for any $s > 0$, $w_s$ to $r_s$ and
        choose the vector $w^*_0$ so that $\inner{w_0}{w^*_0} = -1$.
      Then~\eqref{eq:vector2} is satisfied.

      Now we prove the converse.
      Suppose we found such $w_n$ that~\eqref{eq:vector2} holds.
      Given that the vectors $w_n$ lie in the $\mathbb{R}^k$, we rewrite the scalar product as
        the product of the vector lengths and the cosine of the angle between the vectors.
      Namely, we define $W_n = \lvert w_n\rvert$ and real $\theta_n$ that
        $\inner{w_{n}}{w_{n+1}} = W_n W_{n+1} \cos{\theta_n}.$

      We have $\Xi_n = \sum_0^n \inner{w_s}{w^*_s}$ isolated from zero, so let us
        find the biggest $N > 0$ such that $\Xi_N = 0$.
      Then we can set $w_n$, $w^*_n$ to zero for any $0 \leq n \leq N$, and~\eqref{eq:vector2}
        still holds.
      Therefore, without loss of generality we can assume that $\Xi_n \neq 0$ for any $n \geq 0$.
      %\begin{prop}
        %For a given system $k$ point density is equivalent to the existence such $0 < a'_n \leq a_n$ that
        %\[
          %\nu_n = \frac{a'_{n-1} a'_{n-3} \dots}{a'_{n} a'_{n-2} \dots }
        %\]
        %belongs to $\ell^2$.
      %\end{prop}
      Setting $a'_n = a_n \cos{\theta_n}$ we see that the sequence
      \[
        W_n = \frac{\Xi_{n-1}/a'_n}{\Xi_{n-2}/a'_{n-1}} \cdot \frac{\Xi_{n-3}/a'_{n-2}}{\Xi_{n-4}/a'_{n-3}} \cdots
      \]
        belongs to $\ell^2$.
      Now since $\Xi_n = \sum_0^n \inner{w_s}{w^*_s}$, we discover that
      \[
        \frac{\Xi_n}{\Xi_{n-1}} = 1 + \eta_n,
      \]
        where $\eta_n \in \ell^1$.
      Thus the product of such $(1 + \eta_s)$ fractions is bounded by some constant above.
      It follows that
      \[
        W^\#_n = \frac{1/a'_n}{1/a'_{n-1}} \cdot \frac{1/a'_{n-2}}{1/a'_{n-3}} \cdots
      \]
        belongs to $\ell^2$.
      Now we set $r_n$ to $(-1)^n\frac{W^\#_n}{W_n}w_n$, and then~\eqref{eq:vector2} holds since
      \[
        a_{n+1} \inner{r_n}{r_{n+1}} = -a_{n+1} \frac{1/a'_{n+1}}{\Xi_n/a'_{n+1}} \inner{w_n}{w_{n+1}} = 1.
      \]
      Since $\lvert r_n \rvert = \lvert W^\#_n \rvert$ and $\lvert W^\#_n \rvert$ belongs to $\ell^2$,
        then $r_n \in \ell^2$ as well.
    \end{proof}

    Now we are ready to finish the proof.
    First we prove the theorem for the case $k=1$.
    \begin{prop}
      The system $\fsys$ is one point dense if and only if $\mu_n$ does not belong to $\ell^2$.
    \end{prop}
    \begin{proof}
      Just apply the previous proposition.
    \end{proof}

    The formula for the multidimensional case reduces to the expression of $\mu_n$ whenever we
      set all the angles to zero $\theta_n = 0$.

    And now we consider the higher dimensions.
    We finish the proof of the theorem with the $k > 1$ case.
    \begin{prop}
      The system $\fsys$ is $k$ point dense ($k > 1$) if and only if the sequence $\{1/a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ does not belong to $\ell^1$.
    \end{prop}
    \begin{proof}
      According to Proposition~\ref{prop:reformulation:lw} the $k$ point density is equivalent to the non-existence of
        the sequence of vectors $w_n$ in the $\ell^2(\mathbb{R}^k)$ which satisfy $a_n \inner{w_n}{w_{n-1}} = 1$.
      Obviously if there are such vectors $w_n$ then $1/a_n$ belongs to $\ell^1$.

      Conversely, suppose $1/a_n$ belongs to $\ell^1$.
      Then consider $W_n$ defined as follows:
      \[
        W_n = \max(a_n^{-\frac{1}{2}}, a^{-\frac{1}{2}}_{n+1}).
      \]
      It is easy to see that $W_n$ belongs to $\ell^2$.
      Notice that the product $W_nW_{n-1} \geq 1/\sqrt{a_n}$, and so it is always possible for us to choose the angle $\theta_n$ so that
      \[
        a_n \langle w_n, w_{n-1} \rangle = a_n W_n W_{n-1}\cos{\theta_n} = 1.
      \]
      Now we have defined the lengths for $w_n$ and the angles between two consecutive vectors $w_{n-1}$, $w_n$.
      Obviously, for any $k \geq 2$ we are able to choose the corresponding vectors $w_n$.
      %\textbf{Reasoning 2.}\\
      %Suppose $1/a_n$ is a summable sequence.
      %We need to find such $a'_n$ that $|a'_n| \leq |a_n|$ and $\mu'_n = \frac{a'_{n-1} a'_{n-3} \dots}{a'_{n} a'_{n-2} \dots }$ belongs to $\ell^2$.
      %Note that essentially we need to reduce $a_n$ in such a way that the fractions of the $\mu_n$ type belong to $\ell^2$ (sic!).
      %It appears there is an appropriate sequence $a'_n$ which has a very explicit and compact form:
      %\begin{equation*}
        %a'_n := \begin{cases}
          %\sqrt{a_n a_{n-1}} & \quad a_{n-1} \leq a_n \leq a_{n+1},\\
          %\sqrt{a_n a_{n+1}} & \quad a_{n-1} \geq a_n \geq a_{n+1},\\
          %a_n & \quad a_{n-1} \geq a_n \leq a_{n+1},\\
          %\sqrt{a_{n-1} a_{n+1}} &\quad a_{n-1} \leq a_n \geq a_{n+1}.\\
        %\end{cases}
      %\end{equation*}
      %It is easy to check that for such a sequence $a'_n$ the generated sequence $\mu'_n$ is equal either to $1/\sqrt{a_n}$ or to the $1/\sqrt{a_{n+1}}$.
      %Then obviously the constructed $\mu'_n$ belongs to $\ell^2$.
      %From this construction we are able to calculate the precise lengths $W_n$ and angles $\theta_n$.
    \end{proof}
  \end{proof}
  %\begin{remark}
    %The difference between two cases $k=1$ and $k\geq 2$ is in $\mathbb{R}^1$ any two vectors
      %have $0$ or $\pi$ angle between them.
  %\end{remark}
  % \begin{remark}
  %     Right here we can deduce the necessary and sufficient condition for the $k$-completeness property (for $k>1$) having the condition
  %     for the strong approximation property discovered earlier.
  %     As we remember $f_n$ approximates strongly iff the $a_n^{-1}$ is summable. Also we know as a fact that
  %     a system approximates strongly iff for any $k$ it is $k$-complete. Taking the last proposition into account we
  %     understand that the $k$-completeness condition is the same for all $k > 1$ and is identical to the strong approximation condition: $a_n^{-1}$ must be summable.
