\section{Introduction}
  \subsection{Density properties}
    Consider an infinite-dimensional real Hilbert space $\cal{H}$.
    Suppose that $\cal{H}$ has an orthonormal basis $\{e_j\}_{j=0}^\infty$.
    A sequence $\fsys=\seq{f}$ of vectors in $\cal{H}$ is called \emph{minimal} if none of its elements can be approximated by the linear combinations of the others: $f_n \notin
      \overline{span}\big(\{f_k\}_{k \ne n}\big)$ for any $n$, where $\overline{span}$ denotes the closed linear span.
    The sequence $\fsys$ is said to be \emph{complete} when it spans the whole space $\overline{span}\big(\{f_k\}\big)=\cal{H}$.
    The system $\fstarsys = \{f_l^*\}_{l=0}^\infty$ is \emph{biorthogonal} if for any $k,l \geq 0$ we have $\inner{f_k}{f^*_l} = \delta_{kl}$, where $\delta$ is the Kronecker delta.
    It is known that $\fsys$ is complete and minimal when and only when it possesses a unique biorthogonal system $\fstarsys$.
    We call the minimal system $\fsys$ \emph{band-diagonal} if there exists $L \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\inner{f_t}{e_l} = \inner{f^*_t}{e_l} = 0$
      whenever $\lvert t - l \rvert > L$.
    We say that $\fsys$ is an $M$-basis if $\fsys$ is complete and $\fstarsys$ is complete as well.

    Consider the operator algebra $\cal{A} = \{T\in B(\cal{H}): Tf_n = \lambda_n f_n, \text{ for some } \lambda_n \in \mathbb{R}, n \geq 0\}$
      and the algebra $R_1(\cal{A})$ generated by rank one operators of $\cal{A}$.
    We are interested in the following properties of the algebra $\cal{A}$.
    \begin{definition}[$k$ point density property]
      \label{kpd}
      We say that the algebra $\cal{A}$ has \emph{$k$ point density property} if for any $x_1, x_2,\dots x_k \in \cal{H}$ and $\varepsilon > 0$
        there exists $R\in R_1(\cal{A})$ such that $||Rx_s - x_s|| < \varepsilon$ for any $1 \leq s \leq k$.
    \end{definition}
    The definition for $k=1$ is equivalent to $\fsys$ being a \emph{strong $M$-basis} (see~\cite{katavolos}):
      the system $\fsys$ is called a \emph{strong $M$-basis} if for any $x\in\cal{H}$ we have $x \in \overline{span}\Big(\big\{\inner{x}{f^*_n}f_n\big\}_{n=0}^\infty\Big)$.
    \begin{definition}[rank one density property]
      \label{r1d}
      We say that the algebra $\cal{A}$ has \emph{rank one density property} if the unit ball of rank one subalgebra $R_1(\cal{A})$
        is dense in the unit ball of $\cal{A}$ in the strong operator topology.
    \end{definition}
    By abuse of notation, we say that $\fsys$ is $k$ point dense (rank one dense)
      when the corresponding algebra $R_1(\cal{A})$ is $k$ point dense (rank one dense).

    Notice that rank one density property implies $k$ point density property for any $k$.

  %\subsection{Motivation}
    %Long\-staff in~\cite{longstaff} studied abstract subspace lattices and corresponding operator algebras.
    %In that paper Longstaff raised an important question: does one point density property always imply rank one density property?

    %The solution remained unknown until Larson and Wogen showed~\cite{larson} that the answer is negative.
    %They constructed an example of a vector system $\fsys$ such that it is one point dense but does not possess rank one density property.
    %\begin{example}[Larson--Wogen system $\fsys_{LW}$ parameterized with real $a_n$]
      %\label{lw-sys}
      %For any $j \geq 0$ we define
      %\begin{align*}
        %&f_{2j+1}=-a_{2j+1}e_{2j} + e_{2j+1} + a_{2j+2}e_{2j+2} \qquad &f_{2j}=e_{2j},\\
        %&f^*_{2j}=-a_{2j}e_{2j-1} + e_{2j} + a_{2j+1}e_{2j+1} \qquad &f^*_{2j+1}=e_{2j+1},
      %\end{align*}
      %where $a_n$ are nonzero real numbers for any $n > 0$ and $a_0 = 0$.
    %\end{example}
    %The construction presented by Larson and Wogen was remarkably simple and elementary,~--- notice that the matrices corresponding to
      %the vectors $\{f_j\}_{j=0}^\infty$ and $\{f^*_j\}_{j=0}^\infty$ are both tridiagonal.
    %Afterwards this example was also studied in~\cite{argyroslambrou} (see Addendum), by Azoff and Shehada in~\cite{azoff}, in~\cite{me1}.
    %In 1993 Katavolos, Lambrou and Papadakis in~\cite{katavolos} performed a deep analysis of the density properties
      %of this vector system and deduced that for $\fsys_{LW}$ one point density does not imply rank one density.
    %Moreover, they showed that for such system rank one density is equivalent to two point density.

    %We are going to consider band-diagonal systems similar to the one regarded by Larson and Wogen and to determine the exact conditions
      %for $k$ point density property of such vector systems.
    %In this paper we present a few new techniques for the analysis of $k$ point density and rank one density of band-diagonal vector systems.

\section{Chain of reflexive closures for B-class}
  %\label{sec:preliminaries}
  \begin{definition}
    Let $U$ be a linear subspace of operators.
    Then $ref_k(U) = (F_k \cap R_\perp)^{\perp}$ is called \emph{$k$-reflexive closure} of $U$.
    Here $F_k$ is a linear subspace of all rank $k$ operators, $U_\perp$ means the preannihilator of $U$ and
      $U^\perp$ denotes the annihilator of $U$ (both with respect to the weak star topology induced by trace).
  \end{definition}
  It is well-known that $ref_{k + 1}(U) \subseteq ref_k(U)$ for any linear subspace $U$.

  We will denote the weak star closure of $R$ with $w_0(R)$ and the weak star closure of $R$ and the identity operator with $w(R)$.
  Moreover for any linear subspace $U$ there is a chain of inclusions
  \[
    ref_1(U) \supseteq ref_2(U) \supseteq \dots \supseteq ref_k(U) \supseteq \dots \supseteq w_0(U),
  \]
  In their paper of 1993 Azoff and Shehada (TODO cite) suggested such algebra $U$, generated by
    mutually orthogonal idempotents that only one of inclusions was strict:
  \[
    ref_1(U) = ref_2(U) = \dots = ref_k(U) \supset ref_{k + 1}(U) = ref_{k+2}(U) = \dots = w_0(U),
  \]
    for any given $k > 0$.
  Also they provided an example where all the inclusions were strict.
  This way it was shown that this chain of inclusions can be very different for various $U$.
  The main idea of that paper is tightly connected to the technique in the famous paper of Wogen (TODO cite, "Some counterexamples..."),
    exploiting the infinite matrix and the shift operator.

  For us the first important thing is that the idempotents in their construction were not necessarily rank one operators.
  The second thing is that in their construction the identity operator did not belong even to $ref_1(U)$;
    that is the most intriguing question for us.
  Indeed, the rank one density property is the same as $I \in w_0(R)$,
    while the $k$ point density property is equivalent to having $I$ in $ref_k(R)$.

  Suppose that $\fsys=\{f_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ is an arbitrary B-class $M$-basis and
    $\fstarsys = \{f^*_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ is its biorthogonal sequence.
  Again, we consider the operator algebra $\cal{A} = \{T\in B(\cal{H}): Tf_n = \lambda_n f_n,
    \text{ for some } \lambda_n \in \mathbb{R}, n \geq 0\}$
    and the algebra $R(\cal{A})$ generated by rank one operators of $\cal{A}$.


  The next proposition shows that for B-class the chain of inclusion always contains one strong inclusion.
  \begin{prop}
    \label{prop:chain}
    Then $I \in ref_k(R)$ but $I \not\in ref_{k+1}(R)$ if and only if $R$ is $k + 1$-reflexive but not $k$-reflexive, moreover the
      following holds:
    \[
      \cal{A} = ref_1(R) = ref_2(R) = \dots = ref_k(R) \supset ref_{k + 1}(R) = ref_{k + 2}(R) = \dots = w_0(R).
    \]
  \end{prop}
  This proposition follows from the next one which we prove first.
  It can be seen as a generalization of the proposition of Azoff and Shehada in their paper (TODO cite).
  \begin{prop}
    $w(R)$ is 1-reflexive.
  \end{prop}
  \begin{proof}
    Let $s_n = \sum_{k=1}^n f^*_k \otimes f_k$ and $p_n = \sum_{k=1}^n e_k \otimes e_k$.
    \begin{lemma}
      We have 
      \begin{align*}
        &s_m p_n = p_n s_m = s_m, \qquad n > m + D,\\
        &s_m p_n = p_n s_m = p_n, \qquad n < m - D,
      \end{align*}
      where $D$ is the width of $\fsys$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
      TODO
    \end{proof}
    Suppose we have an operator $t \in w(R)_\perp$.
    It implies that the trace of $t$ is zero.
    We define a finite rank approximations of $t$:
    $t_n = p_n t p_n - \sum_{l = n - D}^{n + D} \alpha_{nl} e_l \otimes e_l,$
    where $\alpha_{nl} = tr(t p_l) - tr(t p_{l - 1})$.
    \begin{lemma}
      The sequence $t_n$ tends to $t$ in SOT.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
      The first member $p_n t p_n$ tends to $t$ in SOT, and the sum of $\alpha_{nl}$ tends to zero,
        since $tr(t) = 0$.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{lemma}
      Each $t_n$ belongs to $w(R)_\perp$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{lemma}
     $t_n$ belongs to a span of rank one operators from $w(R)_\perp$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
      Notice that $t_n = t_n p_{n + D + 1} = t_n p_{n + D + 1} s_n = t_n s_n.$
      Since the $w(R)_\perp$ is closed under multiplication on the elements of the algebra $\cal{A}$,
        each rank one summand of $t_n s_n$ belongs to the preannihilator.
    \end{proof}
    The last lemma finishes the proof of the whole proposition.
  \end{proof}

  \begin{proof}[Proof of~\ref{prop:chain}]
  \end{proof}

\section{B-class: reordered basis view}
  It is conceivable that $\fsys$ is equal to $e_n$ for any even $n$.
  The same can be said about $\fstarsys$ (only $n$ must be odd)
  The idea is to regroup this two parts of $\fsys$ and see what happens.
  

  So lets look at the linear map $\Phi$ that performs the transition between ${e_n}$ and ${f_n}$.
  It is easy to see that it is a two-by-two block matrix:
  \[
    \Phi= \left( {
      \begin{array}{cc}
        I & A\\
        0 & I\\
      \end{array}
    }
  \right).
  \]


  %Now consider an operator $T$ which has a finite rank.
  %In this case we write $T$ as a finite sum $T = \sum_{s=1}^k y^s \otimes x^s$,
    %where $x^s, y^s \in \cal{H}$ and $y \otimes x$ denotes the rank one operator sending a vector $v \in \cal{H}$
    %to $\inner{v}{y}x$.

  %Let us define vectors $v_n$ and $u_n$ in $\mathbb{R}^k$ as follows:
  %\begin{equation*}
    %v_n = (x^1_n, x^2_n, \dots, x^k_n)\qquad
    %u_n = (y^1_n, y^2_n, \dots, y^k_n),
  %\end{equation*}
  %where $x^s_n = \inner{x^s}{e_n}$ and $y^s_n = \inner{y^s}{e_n}$.
  %Since $\inner{Te_m}{e_l} = \inner{u_m}{v_l}$ for any $m$ and $l$, we can rewrite $\Xi_n$ in terms of
    %the scalar products of $\{u_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ and $\{v_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$.
  %In turn it means that~\eqref{eq:prop:ref} can be rewritten in terms of the scalar products
    %of $\{u_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ and $\{v_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$.

  %Hence, the existence of $T$ would be reduced to the existence of
    %the vectors $u_n$, $v_n$ in $\mathbb{R}^k$ such that the sequences $\{\lvert u_n\rvert\}_{n=0}^\infty$,
    %$\{\lvert v_n\rvert\}_{n=0}^\infty$ are both square summable and~\eqref{eq:prop:ref} is satisfied.
  %Thus, instead of looking for $k$ vectors $x^s$ and $y^s$ in $\cal{H}$, we would look for an infinite sequence
    %of $k$-dimensional vectors $v_n$ and $u_n$ such that $\{v_n \}_{n=0}^\infty$, $\{u_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ belong to $\ell^2(\mathbb{R}^k)$.
  %This is one of the key ideas in our method of analysing $k$ point density property for $\fsys$.

  %Thus, we have just found the following reformulation for $k$ point density property.
  %\begin{prop}
    %\label{prop:kreformulation}
    %The following two statements are equivalent:
    %\begin{enumerate}
      %\item there exists a $k$-dimensional operator $T$ which annihilates $R_1(\cal{A})$
        %such that $Tr\, T \neq 0$,
      %\item there exist vectors $\{u_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$, $\{v_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ in $\ell^2(\mathbb{R}^k)$ such that
        %for the operator $\widehat{T} = \displaystyle\sum_{t,l=0}^\infty \inner{u_t}{v_l} e_t \otimes e_l$ we have
        %\begin{equation}
          %\label{eq:thm}
          %\Xi_n + \sum_{m=0}^n \inner{\widehat{T}e_m}{e_m} = 0
        %\end{equation}
          %for any $n \geq 0$.
    %\end{enumerate}
  %\end{prop}
  %As we already mentioned, the equation~\eqref{eq:thm} can be expressed via $u_n$ and $v_n$.
  %Moreover, we can also write the trace of $T$ in terms of $u_n$, $v_n$:
  %%\begin{prop*}
    %\begin{equation}
      %\label{eq:propstar}
      %%\begin{align*}
        %Tr\,T = \sum_{s=1}^k \langle y^s, x^s \rangle = \sum_{s=1}^k \sum_{n=0}^\infty y^s_n x^s_n
              %= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \sum_{s=1}^k y^s_n x^s_n = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \langle u_n, v_n \rangle.
      %%\end{align*}
    %\end{equation}
  %%\end{prop*}
  %Essentially, the $k$ point density property can be viewed as a
    %possibility of placing the sequence of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^k$ which are constrained with
    %a series of relations~\eqref{eq:thm} and~\eqref{eq:propstar}.
