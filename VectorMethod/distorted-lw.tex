\author{Alexey Pyshkin}
\begin{abstract}
  In the early 1990s the works of Larson, Wogen and Argyros, Lambrou, Longstaff
    disclosed an example of a strong tridiagonal $M$-basis that was not rank one dense.
  Later Katavolos, Lambrou and Papadakis studied the $k$ point density property of this example.
  In this paper we present a new method for the $k$ point density property analysis of band-diagonal
    $M$-bases.

\section{Introduction}
  \subsection{Density properties}
    Consider a complete minimal vector system $\fsys = \seq{f}$ in the infinite-dimensional real Hilbert space $\cal{H}$.
    Suppose that $\cal{H}$ has an orthonormal basis $\{e_j\}_{j=0}^\infty$.
    The sequence is called \emph{minimal} if none of its elements can be approximated by the linear combinations of the others.
    The system $\fsys$ is minimal when and only when it possesses a unique biorthogonal system $\fstarsys$.
    We call the minimal system $\fsys$ \emph{band-diagonal} if there is $L \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\inner{f_k}{e_l} = \inner{f^*_k}{e_l} = 0$
      whenever $\lvert k - l \rvert > L$.
    We say that $\fsys$ is an $M$-basis if $\fstarsys$ is complete as well.
    Let ${\cal{A} = \{T\in B(\cal{H}): Tf_n \in \overline{span}(f_n), \text{ for any } n \in \mathbb{N}\}}$ be an operator algebra, where
      $\overline{span}$ denotes a closed linear span;
      and $R_1(\cal{A})$ be an algebra generated by the rank one operators of $\cal{A}$.
    %We denote by $\lattice$ the lattice of invariant subspaces for operators in $\cal{A}$.

    We are interested in the following properties of the algebra $\cal{A}$.
    %\begin{definition}[one point density property]
      %\label{1pd}
      %We say that $\fsys$ is \emph{one point dense} if for any $x \in \cal{H}$ and $\varepsilon > 0$
        %there exists such $T\in \cal{A}$ that $||Tx - x|| < \varepsilon$.
    %\end{definition}
    \begin{definition}[$k$ point density property]
      \label{kpd}
      We say that the algebra $\cal{A}$ is \emph{$k$ point dense} if for any $x_1, x_2,\dots x_k \in \cal{H}$ and $\varepsilon > 0$
        there exists such $T\in \cal{A}$ that $||Tx_s - x_s|| < \varepsilon$ for any $1 \leq s \leq k$.
    \end{definition}
    The definition for $k=1$ is equivalent to $\fsys$ being a \emph{strong $M$-basis} (see~\cite{katavolos}):
      the system $\fsys$ is called a \emph{strong $M$-basis} if for any $x\in\cal{H}$ we have $x \in \overline{span}\big(\inner{x}{f^*_k}f_k\big)$, where
      $\overline{span}$ denotes a closed linear span.
    \begin{definition}[rank one density property]
      \label{r1d}
      We say that the algebra $\cal{A}$ is \emph{rank one dense} if the unit ball of the rank one subalgebra $R_1(\cal{A})$
        is dense in the unit ball of $\cal{A}$ in the strong operator topology.
    \end{definition}
    By abuse of notation, we say that $\fsys$ is $k$ point dense (rank one dense)
      when the corresponding algebra $\cal{A}$ is $k$ point dense (rank one dense).

    Notice that the rank one density property~\eqref{r1d} implies the $k$ point density property~\eqref{kpd} for any $k$.
    Conversely, there is an easy compactness argument which shows that $\fsys$ is rank one dense if it is
      $k$ point dense for any $k > 0$.

  \subsection{Motivation}
    %It is well known that the last definition is equivalent to $R_1(\cal{A})$ being dense
      %in $\cal{A}$ in the ultraweak (or $\sigma$-weak) topology.
    %Rank one density property can be considered as a generalization of the notion of \emph{linear summation method} for the system $\fsys$.
    %We say that the system $\fsys$ admits a linear summation method if there exist $\alpha_{kn} \in \mathbb{C}, n \in \mathbb{N}, 0 < k < k_n$
      %such that for any $x \in \cal{H}$,
      %\[
        %\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_k \alpha_{kn} \inner{x}{f^*_k}f_k = x.
      %\]
    %Clearly, the existence of the linear summation method implies the rank one density property.

    %Notice that the rank one density property~\eqref{r1d} implies the two point density property~\eqref{kpd}, and~\eqref{kpd}
      %in its turn implies the one point density property~\eqref{1pd}.
    %But is it true that $\eqref{1pd}$ implies $\eqref{r1d}$ or that~\eqref{kpd} implies~\eqref{r1d}?

    %It is now a well-known fact that for a subspace lattice generated from an $M$-basis the complete distributivity of its lattice is equivalent to
      %the property~\eqref{1pd} (see~\cite{argyroslambrou} for a proof).
    %In the same paper the following question was raised: does the complete distributivity of $\lattice$ imply the rank one density property?
    %The answer was already known to be positive in the case of a totally ordered lattice~\cite{erdos}, and
      %Longstaff proved it for a finite-dimensional Hilbert space in~\cite{longstaff}.
    %Later Laurie and Longstaff discovered that the rank one density holds in the case of commutative subspace lattices~\cite{laurielongstaff}.
    Long\-staff in~\cite{longstaff} studied abstract subspace lattices and corresponding operator algebras.
    In that paper Longstaff raised an important question: does one point density property always implies the rank one density property?

    The solution remained unknown until Larson and Wogen showed that the answer is negative (see~\cite{larson}).
    They constructed an example of a vector system $\fsys$ such that it is one point dense but does not possess the rank one density property.
    \begin{example}[Larson--Wogen system $\fsys_{LW}$ parameterized with real $a_k$]
      \label{lw-sys}
      For any $j \geq 0$ we define
      \begin{align*}
        &f_{2j+1}=-a_{2j+1}e_{2j} + e_{2j+1} + a_{2j+2}e_{2j+2}, \qquad &f_{2j}=e_{2j},\\
        &f^*_{2j}=-a_{2j}e_{2j-1} + e_{2j} + a_{2j+1}e_{2j+1}, \qquad &f^*_{2j+1}=e_{2j+1},
      \end{align*}
      where $a_k$ are nonzero real numbers for any $k > 0$ and $a_0 = 0$.
    \end{example}
    The construction presented by Larson and Wogen was remarkably simple and elementary,~--- notice that the matrices corresponding to
      the vectors $\{f_j\}_{j=0}^\infty$ and $\{f^*_j\}_{j=0}^\infty$ are both tridiagonal.
    Afterwards this example was also studied in~\cite{argyroslambrou} (see Addendum) and by Azoff and Shehada in~\cite{azoff}.
    Finally, Katavolos, Lambrou and Papadakis in~\cite{katavolos} performed a deep analysis of the density properties
      of this vector system and deduced that for $\fsys_{LW}$ one point density property does not imply rank point density property~\eqref{r1d}.
    Moreover, they showed that~\eqref{r1d} always implies two point density property.

    We want to consider band-diagonal systems similar to the one regarded by Larson and Wogen and to determine the exact conditions
      for the $k$ point density property of such vector systems.
    It seems that in the general case it is rather easy to find the parameter conditions under which the system is rank one dense;
      on the other hand, it is not clear how to study $k$ point density property.
    In this paper we present a new technique for analysis of $k$ point density property of a band-diagonal vector system.

    In the next section we will gather some common facts and outline the main idea of the paper.
    In Section~\ref{section:lw-sys} we perform the analysis for the Larson--Wogen example providing the simpler proof of Theorems 2.1 and 2.2 in~\cite{katavolos}.
    In Section~\ref{section:pentadiagonal} we prove a similar theorem for one pentadiagonal system.
\section{Preliminaries}
  \label{sec:preliminaries}
  Suppose that $\fsys=\{f_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ is an arbitrary band-diagonal $M$-basis and $\{f^*_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ is its biorthogonal sequence.
  In this section we establish several facts about this system.
  \begin{prop}
  %It means that $Tr(TR) = 0$ for each $R \in \cal{R}_1(\cal{A})$ which is equivalent to $\inner{Tf_n}{f_n^*} = 0$ for any $n$.
    The system $\fsys$ is rank one dense whenever each trace class operator $T$,
      such that $\inner{Tf_n}{f_n^*} = 0$ for any $n$, has a zero trace.
  \end{prop}
  \begin{proof}
    It is well known that the rank one density definition is equivalent to $R_1(\cal{A})$ being dense
      in $\cal{A}$ in the ultraweak (or $\sigma$-weak) topology (see~\cite{katavolos}, Theorem 2.2).
  \end{proof}
  \begin{prop}
    The system $\fsys$ is $k$ point dense whenever each $k$-dimensional operator $T$,
      such that $\inner{Tf_n}{f_n^*} = 0$ for any $n$, has a zero trace.
  \end{prop}
  \begin{proof}
    In the paper~\cite{katavolos} authors proved the proposition for $k = 2$.
    For greater $k$s the same reasoning works.
  \end{proof}
  For an arbitrary linear operator $T$ we can define the differences between
    the partial sums of the Fourier series using the system $\fsys$ and
    partial sums of the canonical Fourier series (using the orthonormal basis $e_k$).
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:xi}
    \Xi_n = -\sum_{s=0}^n \inner{Te_s}{e_s} + \sum_{s=0}^n \inner{Tf_s}{f_s^*},
  \end{equation}
    where the $\langle \cdot, \cdot\rangle$ denotes a standard scalar product in $\cal{H}$.
  It appears that $\Xi_n$ takes a concise form for a finite-band system $\fsys$, and it is much easier to study $\Xi_n$
    than, for example, $\inner{Tf_s}{f_s^*}$.

  \begin{prop}
    \label{prop:reformulation}
    Notice that $T$ is a trace class operator annihilating the subalgebra $R_1(\cal{A})$ if and only if
      for any $n \geq 0$ one has $\Xi_n = -\sum_{s=0}^n \inner{Te_s}{e_s}$.
  \end{prop}
    We will work with this formulation in the following sections.

  Now assume that the operator $T$ has a finite rank.
  In that case we write $T$ as a finite sum $T = \sum_{s=1}^k y^s \otimes x^s$,
    where $x^s, y^s \in \cal{H}$.

  Let us define vectors $v_n$ and $u_n$ which lie within $\mathbb{R}^k$ as follows:
  \begin{align*}
    v_n &= (x^1_n, x^2_n, \dots, x^k_n),\\
    u_n &= (y^1_n, y^2_n, \dots, y^k_n).
  \end{align*}
  Since $\inner{Te_k}{e_l} = \inner{u_k}{v_l}$ for any $k$ and $l$, we can rewrite $\Xi_n$ in terms of
    the scalar products of $\{u_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ and $\{v_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$.
  In turn that means that the condition from Proposition~\ref{prop:reformulation} $\Xi_n = -\sum_{s=0}^n \inner{Te_s}{e_s}$
    can be rewritten in terms of the scalar products of $\{u_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ and $\{v_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$.

  Hence, the existence of $T$ might be reduced to the existence of
    the vectors $u_n$, $v_n$ in $\mathbb{R}^k$ (such that $\lvert u_n\rvert$, $\lvert v_n\rvert$ are both square summable)
    which respect the condition given in~\ref{prop:reformulation}.
  Thus, instead of looking for $k$ Hilbert elements $x^s$ and $y^s$ we might look for an infinite sequence
    of $k$-dimensional vectors $v_n$ and $u_n$ such that $\lvert v_n \rvert$, $\lvert u_n \rvert$ belong to $\ell^2$.
  Obviously we can also write the trace of $T$ in terms of $u_n$, $v_n$.
  \begin{align*}
    Tr T &= \sum_{s=1}^k \langle y^s, x^s \rangle = \sum_{s=1}^k \sum_{n=0}^\infty y^s_n x^s_n =\\
         &= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \sum_{s=1}^k y^s_n x^s_n = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \langle u_n, v_n \rangle.
  \end{align*}

  Thus we have just found the following reformulation for the $k$ point density property.
  \begin{prop}
    \label{prop:kreformulation}
    There exists a $k$-dimensional operator $T$ which annihilates $R_1(\cal{A})$
      such that $Tr T \neq 0$ if and only if
      there exist vectors $u_n$, $v_n \in \mathbb{R}^k$ such that
      $\lvert v_n \rvert$, $\lvert u_n \rvert$ are square summable,
      $\sum_{n=0}^\infty \inner{u_n}{v_n} \neq 0$, and the following holds:
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:thm}
        \Xi_n = -\sum_{s=0}^n \inner{u_s}{v_s},
      \end{equation}
      for any $n \geq 0$.
  \end{prop}
  Essentially, the last theorem asserts that the $k$ point density property can viewed as a
    possibility of laying out the sequence of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^k$ which is constricted with
    a series of relations~\eqref{eq:thm}.
