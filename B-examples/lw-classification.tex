\section{Classification for the Larson--Wogen $M$-basis}
  \label{section:lw-sys}
  In this section we study Larson--Wogen vector system $\fsys_{LW}$ (Example~\ref{lw-sys}).
  Namely, we prove a theorem similar to Theorem 2.2 of~\cite{katavolos}.
  Up until now there existed two different techniques in studying $k$ point density, one for $k=1$ (strong $M$-bases)
    and a different one for $k\geq2$.
  Here we demonstrate a universal method for the analysis of $k$ point density property.
  \begin{theorem}[\cite{katavolos}, Theorem 2.2]
    \label{thm:katavolos}
    The sequences $\fsys_{LW}$ and $\fsys_{LW}^*$ are biorthogonal and both are complete in $\cal{H}$.
    Moreover, the following is true.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item  the system $\fsys_{LW}$ is one point dense (a strong $M$-basis) if and only if the sequence
        \begin{equation}
          \mu_n = \frac{a_{n-1} a_{n-3} \dots}{a_{n} a_{n-2} \dots }
        \end{equation}
        does not belong to $\ell^2$.
      \item the system $\fsys_{LW}$ is $k$ point dense ($k > 1$) if and only if the sequence $\{1/a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ does not belong to $\ell^1$.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}
    Due to Proposition~\ref{prop:kreformulation} we know that $k$ point density of the system $\fsys$ is equivalent to the existence of $k$-dimensional
      vectors $u_n$, $v_n$ such that~\eqref{eq:thm} holds for the corresponding operator $T$.
    %We reproduce the logic from the previous section and define $\Xi_n$, $u_n$, $v_n$ exactly in the way it is described there.
    For the given $M$-basis $\fsys = \fsys_{LW}$ we can calculate $\Xi_n$ precisely:
    \begin{align*}
      \Xi_{2n-1} &= a_{2n}T_{2n - 1, 2n},\\
      \Xi_{2n} &= a_{2n + 1}T_{2n + 1, 2n},
    \end{align*}
      where $T_{ij} = \inner{Te_j}{e_i}$.

    Since $T_{ij} = \inner{u_j}{v_i}$, we have
    \begin{align*}
      \Xi_{2n-1} &= a_{2n}   \inner{u_{2n}}{v_{2n-1}},\\
      \Xi_{2n}   &= a_{2n+1} \inner{u_{2n}}{v_{2n+1}},
    \end{align*}
      where $\langle\cdot, \cdot\rangle$ denotes the scalar product in $\mathbb{R}^k$.

    For the convenience of the reader we will introduce the sequences of vectors $w_n$ and $w^*_n$.
    \begin{align*}
      w_{2n} &= u_{2n}, \quad w^*_{2n} = v_{2n},\\
      w_{2n+1} &= v_{2n+1}, \quad w^*_{2n+1} = u_{2n+1}.
    \end{align*}
    In view of this notation $\Xi_n = a_{n+1} \inner{w_n}{w_{n+1}}$ and due to Equation~\eqref{eq:propstar}
      $Tr\, T = \sum_{m=0}^\infty \inner{w_m}{w^*_m}$.

    Thus, we get that $\fsys$ is not $k$ point dense if and only if there exist
      $k$-dimensional vectors $\{w_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$, $\{w^*_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ lying in $\ell^2(\mathbb{R}^k)$ such that
    \begin{equation}
      \label{eq:vector2}
      a_{n+1} \inner{w_n}{w_{n+1}} = -\sum_{m=0}^n \inner{w_m}{w^*_m},
    \end{equation}
      for any $n \geq 0$, and $\sum_{m=0}^\infty \inner{w_m}{w^*_m} \neq 0$.

    \medskip
    In what follows we show that the latter can be simplified even more.
    \begin{prop}
      \label{prop:reformulation-lw}
      The system $\fsys$ is not $k$ point dense if and only if there exists a sequence of vectors
        $\{r_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ in $\ell^2(\mathbb{R}^k)$ such that
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:vector3}
        a_{n+1} \inner{r_n}{r_{n+1}} = 1,
      \end{equation}
        for any $n \geq 0$.
    \end{prop}
    \begin{proof}
      Suppose we found such $r_n$.
      Then we solve~\eqref{eq:vector2} by putting $w^*_n$ to zero, $w_n$ to $r_n$ for any $n > 0$ and
        choosing the vector $w^*_0$ so that $\inner{w_0}{w^*_0} = -1$.

      Now we prove the converse.
      Suppose we found such $w_n$ that~\eqref{eq:vector2} holds.
      Given that the vectors $w_n$ lie in $\mathbb{R}^k$, we rewrite the scalar product as
        the product of the vector lengths and the cosine of the angle between the vectors.
      Namely, we define $W_n = \lvert w_n\rvert$ and real $\theta_n$ that
        $\inner{w_{n}}{w_{n+1}} = W_n W_{n+1} \cos{\theta_n}.$

      The sequence $\Xi_n = -\sum_0^n \inner{w_m}{w^*_m}$ has a non-zero limit, so let us
        find the largest $N > 0$ such that $\Xi_N = 0$.
      Then we can modify the original sequence by setting $w_n$, $w^*_n$ to zero for any $0 \leq n \leq N$ so that~\eqref{eq:vector2}
        still holds.
      Therefore, without loss of generality we can assume that $\Xi_n \neq 0$ for any $n \geq 0$.
      %\begin{prop}
        %For a given system $k$ point density is equivalent to the existence such $0 < a'_n \leq a_n$ that
        %\[
          %\nu_n = \frac{a'_{n-1} a'_{n-3} \dots}{a'_{n} a'_{n-2} \dots }
        %\]
        %belongs to $\ell^2$.
      %\end{prop}
      Setting $a'_n = a_n \cos{\theta_n}$ we see that the sequence
      \[
        W_n = \frac{\Xi_{n-1}/a'_n}{\Xi_{n-2}/a'_{n-1}} \cdot \frac{\Xi_{n-3}/a'_{n-2}}{\Xi_{n-4}/a'_{n-3}} \cdots
      \]
        belongs to $\ell^2$.
      Now since $\Xi_n = -\sum_0^n \inner{w_m}{w^*_m}$, we discover that
      \[
        \frac{\Xi_n}{\Xi_{n-1}} = 1 + \eta_n,
      \]
        where $\{\eta_n\}_{n=1}^\infty \in \ell^1$.
      Thus the product of such $(1 + \eta_m)$ fractions is bounded by some constant above.
      It follows that the sequence
      \[
        W^\#_n = \frac{1/a'_n}{1/a'_{n-1}} \cdot \frac{1/a'_{n-2}}{1/a'_{n-3}} \cdots
      \]
        belongs to $\ell^2$.
      Now we set $r_n$ to $\frac{W^\#_n}{W_n}w_n$, and then~\eqref{eq:vector2} holds since
      \[
        a_{n+1} \inner{r_n}{r_{n+1}} = a_{n+1} \frac{1/a'_{n+1}}{\Xi_n/a'_{n+1}} \inner{w_n}{w_{n+1}} = 1.
      \]
      Since $\lvert r_n \rvert = \lvert W^\#_n \rvert$ and the sequence $\left\{\lvert W^\#_n \rvert\right\}_{n=1}^\infty$ belongs to $\ell^2$,
        the sequence $\{r_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ belongs to $\ell^2(\mathbb{R}^k)$ as well.
    \end{proof}

    Now we are ready to prove the theorem for the case $k=1$.
    \begin{prop}
      The system $\fsys_{LW}$ is one point dense if and only if $\seqone{\mu}$ does not belong to $\ell^2$.
    \end{prop}
    \begin{proof}
      It follows from Proposition~\ref{prop:reformulation-lw}.

      The case $k=1$ has all the vectors $r_n$, $r^*_n$ lying on the same line ($\mathbb{R}^1$).
      Since all $r_n$ are collinear, the lengths of the vectors $r_n$ are precisely $\mu_n$.
      Hence, Equation~\eqref{eq:vector3} can be satisfied if and only if $\seqone{\mu}$ is square summable.
    \end{proof}

    After this we consider the case $k > 1$.
    \begin{prop}
      The system $\fsys_{LW}$ is $k$ point dense \textup($k > 1$\textup) if and only if the sequence $\{1/a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$
        does not belong to $\ell^1$.
    \end{prop}
    \begin{proof}
      According to Proposition~\ref{prop:reformulation-lw}, the system $\fsys_{LW}$ is $k$ point dense
        if and only if there is no such sequence $\seq{r}$ in $\ell^2(\mathbb{R}^k)$ which satisfy $a_n \inner{r_n}{r_{n-1}} = 1$.
      Obviously, if there are such vectors $r_n$, then $\{1/a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ belongs to $\ell^1$.

      Conversely, suppose $\{1/a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ belongs to $\ell^1$.
      Then the sequence $R_n = \max(\lvert a_n \rvert^{-\frac{1}{2}}, \lvert a_{n+1} \rvert^{-\frac{1}{2}})$ is square summable.
      Observe that $R_nR_{n-1} \geq 1/\lvert a_n\rvert$, and so it is always possible to choose the angle $\theta_n$ so that
      \[
        a_n \langle r_n, r_{n-1} \rangle = a_n R_n R_{n-1}\cos{\theta_n} = 1.
      \]
      Now we have defined the lengths for $r_n$ and the angles between each two consecutive vectors $r_{n-1}$, $r_n$.
      Obviously, for any $k \geq 2$ we are able to place the vectors $r_n$ in $\mathbb{R}^k$.
    \end{proof}
    The last two propositions prove Theorem~\ref{thm:katavolos}.
  \end{proof}
  %\begin{remark}
    %The difference between two cases $k=1$ and $k\geq 2$ is in $\mathbb{R}^1$ any two vectors
      %have $0$ or $\pi$ angle between them.
  %\end{remark}
  % \begin{remark}
  %     Right here we can deduce the necessary and sufficient condition for the $k$-completeness property (for $k>1$) having the condition
  %     for the strong approximation property discovered earlier.
  %     As we remember $f_n$ approximates strongly iff the $a_n^{-1}$ is summable. Also we know as a fact that
  %     a system approximates strongly iff for any $k$ it is $k$-complete. Taking the last proposition into account we
  %     understand that the $k$-completeness condition is the same for all $k > 1$ and is identical to the strong approximation condition: $a_n^{-1}$ must be summable.
